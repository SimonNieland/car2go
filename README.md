Scripts for interfacing with Car2Go's API.

This script downloads all available (un-rented) Car2Go vehicles for user-specified regions and a given time interval. 

To run the script, users must first register for a Car2Go API account: https://code.google.com/p/car2go/wiki/index_v2_1. 

Car2Go restricts data collection for "tracking" purposes, so please follow the legal guidelines and beware that
Car2Go could reject your access request if it believes you may be using the data for overly-intrusive purposes. 

Our purposes are not specifically to track vehicles, but to understand aggregate fleet usage and vehicle availability 
over time and space in context of other transportation options. Car2Go provides a dimension of mobility that we hope to
measure and possibly integrate within our regional modeling and planning efforts.
